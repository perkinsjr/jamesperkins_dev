## What is Developer Relations?

Developers relations / advocacy is a role that is a mix of Sales, Marketing, Developer and Educator. Our role at any company is too encourage developers to adopt a platform, but, more importantly in my opinion is making developers successful. 

### What do developers relations do?

Each dev rel might have different goals but for me and quite a few people I know in the space do the following week to week:

1. Check GitHub issues
2. Communicate via Discord, forums, Slack and Twitter.
3. Create content through YouTube, Twitch, Blog posts
4. Update guides and documentation 
5. Feed the feedback loop machine
6. Test new features to be up to date 
7. Collaborate with others 
8. Conferences
