title: Developer Relations what do we do?
excerpt: >
  Developers relations / advocacy is a role that is a mix of Sales, Marketing,
  Developer and Educator. Our role at any company is too encourage developers to
  adopt a platform, but, more importantly in my opinion is making developers
  successful.
