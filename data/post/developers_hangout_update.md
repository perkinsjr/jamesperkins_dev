title: Developers Hangout Podcast Update
excerpt: >-
  The Developers Hangout podcast has been rocking and rolling for almost two
  months. I've had some fantastic guests and have some even greater ones coming
  in the future.


  When I first started Developers Hangout podcast, I wanted it to be a live show
  that people could tune in to and watch. What I realized was this was not
  sustainable, as only a few of the thousands of developers in the world could
  be available at 3.30PM EST.

### What is happening now?

The Developers Hangout podcast is going to go from a Livestreamed show to prerecorded. It is also getting it's own YouTube Channel, so people can watch the episodes as they wish without filling my own YouTube channel of podcast episodes.
