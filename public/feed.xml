            <description><![CDATA[The Developers Hangout podcast has been rocking and rolling for almost two months. I've had some fantastic guests and have some even greater ones coming in the future.

When I first started Developers Hangout podcast, I wanted it to be a live show that people could tune in to and watch. What I realized was this was not sustainable, as only a few of the thousands of developers in the world could be available at 3.30PM EST.]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Why I embraced Typescript for development.]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[I've been very much avoiding using Typescript for quite a while, not because I don't believe in statically typed software, I spent a decade in production Java and was a certified PERL developer. I just never found a reason to use it, being a content creator and Jamstack developer for the past 3 years I have just been using JavaScript without much issue. If I ended up working on a project with typescript I just understood the system coded and moved on. ]]></description>
